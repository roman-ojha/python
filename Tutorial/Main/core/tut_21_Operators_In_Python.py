# Operators In Pythons:
# Arithmetic Operators
# Assignment Operators
# Comparison Operators
# Logical Operators
# Identity Operators
# Membership Operators
# Bitwise Operators

# Arithmetic Operators
# print("5 + 6 is ", 5+6)
# print("5 - 6 is ", 5-6)
# print("5 * 6 is ", 5*6)
# print("5 / 6 is ", 5/6)
# print("5 ** 3 is ", 5**3) # this means 5 to the power three it is called as exponantiol operator
# print("5 % 5 is ", 5%5)
# print("15 // 6 is ", 15//6) # this will give the value in int form it is called as floor division operator

# Assignment Operators
# print("Assignment Operators")
# x = 5
# x += 7
# print(x)
# x %=7
# # x = x%7
# print(x)

# Comparison Operators
# i = 5
# print(i != 5)
# print(i == 5)
# print(i < 5)
# print(i <= 5)
# print(i > 5)
# print(i >= 5)


# Logical Operators
# 1) and
# 2) or
# 3) not
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b)

# Identity Operators
# print(5 is 5)
# print(5 is not 5)

# Membership Operators
# list = [3, 3, 2, 2, 39, 33, 35, 32]
# print(32 in list)
# print(324 not in list)

# Bitwise Operators
# 0 - 00
# 1 - 01
# 2 - 10
# 3 - 11

# print(0 & 2)
# print(0 | 3)
